# Energy Consumption Predictor

A simple tool to predict energy usage, helping users save costs and promote sustainable energy practices.
A project me and my friends made for AI GENESIS HACKATHON

## Features
- Predicts energy consumption
- Highlights usage patterns
- Supports data-driven energy management

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository
2. Install required packages
3. Run the predictor script

## Future Improvements
- Add real-time data input
- Integrate with smart home devices
- Improve prediction accuracy with more data

Install dependencies:


pip install -r requirements.txt



Run the Streamlit app:


streamlit run app.py

Usage


Select a country and an energy indicator from the dropdown menus.


View the historical data table.


Optionally, see the latest data from the World Bank.


Click Forecast Next 5 Years to generate predictions and a plot.


Dataset
The project uses a CSV file pa-retp-indicators.csv containing historical energy consumption indicators. You can replace it with your own dataset if needed.
Future Improvements


Add more forecasting models for better accuracy


Allow custom time horizons for predictions


Include more energy indicators


Enhance the visualization with interactive charts
